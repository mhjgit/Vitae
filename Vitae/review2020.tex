\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Courses I teach}
During the last year I have been responsible for four courses, one at MSU (spring) and three at the University of Oslo (Fall semester and Spring semester)
\begin{itemize}
\item {PHY321 Classical Mechanics}, undergraduate level, Spring semester (MSU), 61 students Spring 2020 

\item {FYS3150/4150 Computational Physics I}, Fall semester, senior undergraduate level (Oslo), 100 students Fall 2019. 

\item{FYS-STK3155/4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning}, Fall semester, graduate course (Oslo). 130 students fall 2019.
  
\item {FYS4411 Computational Physics II: Quantum mechanical systems}, graduate level, Spring semester (Oslo). Online teaching only.  14 students spring 2020.

This spring semester, due to Covid-19, required from all of us extra
efforts when we transited to online teaching. Since I had already
taught many classes remotely during the last decade, I felt the transition gave me the
possibility to explore alternative ways of organizing the lectures. I
have always preferred a project oriented way of teaching. With PHY 321
being fully online after spring break, this allowed me to transform
the final exam and the midterm exam to two one-week long
projects. With the introduction of numerical exercises as well (an a
weekly basis) plus numerical projects, this allowed the students to
explore mechanics from a more research based point of view. Although
all these efforts took a heavy toll timewise, I feel, seen the student
evaluation on SIRS, that the efforts were much appreciated. All in
all, although I have spent a lot of time on educational activities
both for the students at our lab and on regular courses, I feel this
to be an important contribution to our community. The intensive
courses on Machine Learning for Nuclear Physics have been extremely
rewarding to teach. The Nuclear Talent course we taught recently had
157 registered participants.  These courses have also opened up many interesting research avenues on Machine Learning.


\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Personal Summary}

I started in January 2012 at Michigan State University. I have a
shared position between the University of Oslo and Michigan State
University.

My main activity is on studies of nuclear physics systems, with an
emphasis on many-body methods for nuclear structure studies. In
particular, I wish to understand the stability of nuclear matter and
nuclei from first principle methods. This matches perfectly the
scientific mission of the NSCL and FRIB at MSU.

During the last three years I have also started new activities on Machine Learning applied to Nuclear Physics (experiment and theory). This has lead to several collaborations, among these
\begin{enumerate}
\item Deep Learning methods applied to regression and classification of $\beta$-decay experiments with Sean Liddick and collaborators.
\item Deep Learning methods applied to classification of active target experiments with Daniel Bazin and collaborators (see paper submitted to NIM).
\item Deep learning methods and studies of the Equation of state for dense matter. Collaboration with Betty Tsang and Dean Lee
\item On the theory started we submitted recently a large center application to the NSF. Unfortunately we did not succeed. However, we have started recently a large collaboration among several theorists (Bogner, Hergert, Lee, Nazarewicz and myself) on theoretical developments of deep learning methods appled to the nuclear many-body problem.
\end{enumerate}.

Moreover, also during the last three years, we have started a larger
collaboration at the lab on studies of Quantum Computing algorithms
applied to the nuclear many-body problem. This collaboration involves
several colleagues at the lab, Bogner, Hergert, Lee and Shindler, plus
other colleagues at MSU. We received recently funding for this from
the DoE. We have also recruited several excellent students. The
nuclear many-body problem is perhaps one of the most difficult
quantum-mechanical problems studied with powerful
supercomputers. Quantum computing has emerged as a new computational
paradigm that could circumvent the challenges and limitations
encountered on classical computers.Â In our new project we  propose to create a bridge
between quantum computing as it exists today and unsolved nuclear
physics problems by developing new quantum algorithms, exploring
applications of quantum error stabilzation techniques, machine
learning and quantum compiling for realizing efficient short-depth
quantum circuits. This award also focuses on creative adaptations of
quantum simulators to many-body problems in nuclear physics.Â 

Our studies here have also created new collaborations between us and
colleagues at other departments at MSU.  Amongst these are Johannes
Pollanen (experimental condensed matter physics), Huey-Wen Lin
(particle physics) and several colleagues at the newly established
department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering.


I have also a strong educational commitment, reflected in the
initiation and partecipation in a project at the University of Oslo
called 'Computing in Science Education'. This project has changed
totally the way we teach science, with computations being introduced
at first semester of study. Many of the seminars I have given at
various US institutions deal with the integration of a computational
approach to the basic science courses. Locally at MSU I am involved in
similar activities in close collaboration with Danny Caballero and his research team.
We share a common research grant on educational activities.
I have continuous discussions with
several colleagues at the FRIB/NSCL, the Department of Physics and
Astronomy and the new Department of Computational Mathematics, Science
and Engineering on computational issues and education in computational
aspects. Much inspired by the developments at MSU, I have initiated
and chair a Master of Science program in Computational Science at the
University of Oslo, Norway. I spend the period July-December in
Norway.


Finally, my long term goal is to be able to contribute to build up a
strong activity on the nuclear many-body problem at MSU, an activity
which will match the experimental program at the FRIB/NSCL. With
Scott Bogner and Heiko Hergert we have a group of several excellent graduate students. It is a great pleasure to be able to be here and contribute to the development of our field in close contact with so many excellent researchers.
