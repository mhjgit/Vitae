===== Overarching goals =====


Where do atomic nuclei come from? How are they organized? What is the size of the atomic nucleus?
Why is matter stable? What are
their practical and scientific uses? The answers to these and many
other questions are central overarching aims and intellectual
challenges of basic research in nuclear physics.  To relate the
existence and properties of nuclei to the underlying fundamental
forces and laws of motion, is central to present and planned
facilities in nuclear physics worldwide.
State University in the USA.
A proper understanding of the laws of motion has far
reaching consequences for our understanding of nuclei and nuclear
matter, spanning from the structure and stability of visible matter, to the
synthesis of the elements and dense objects like neutron stars.


A neutron star is the possible and fascinating final stage in the life
of massive stars, that is stars normally bigger than our sun. Neutron
stars have masses larger than our sun and a radius around ten
kilometers. A nucleus on the other hand is a miniscule object with a radius
almost nineteen orders of magnitude smaller than a neutron star,
approximately one thousand trillionth meters.  An important challenge
in modern nuclear physics, as well as in many other disciplines in the
physical sciences, is whether we can relate the description of such
tiny systems like nuclei with the physics of massive objects
like neutron stars, that is to link physical mechanisms across many
energy and length scales.  This has been one of the overarching aims of this research proposal, namely to descrive and develop theories which can describe systems where many length and energy scales are involved. 

To be able to model such systems theoretically and as reliably as
possible, has important consequences for our present and future
experimental programs, since theoretical modeling can aid in providing
guidance for new experiments as well as fundamental insights about Nature's 
laws of motion and forces. In the quest for such a comprehensive theory,
high performance computing plays a central role.


The progress achieved enables a quantitative description of nuclei
based on first principles. The obtained results offer new insights
into neutron-rich matter and illuminate how features of nuclear forces
determine the basic properties of atomic nuclei. This work has
significant consequences for our basic understanding of nuclei.
Combined with the exciting experimental program at present and planned experimental
facilities worldwide, there is great hope that within the next two
decades, researchers will be able to gain deeper insights about our
fascinating microscopic world, impacting intellectual challenges like
why matter is stable and how the elements are formed.


Several articles in the Physical Review Letters have been published, as well as long 
review articles.
In a forthcoming article to be published in Nature Physics, authored
by Dr. Gaute Hagen of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and
his collaborators, amongst these Morten Hjorth-Jensen from the university of Oslo, 
advanced computational tools and sophisticated
theoretical models have been used to compute the neutron density and
related observables of the doubly-magic nucleus calcium-48 (a nucleus
with 20 protons and 28 neutrons). The authors obtain an excellent
agreement with experiment for the radius of the charge distribution
and predict that the neutron radius of calcium-48 is smaller than
previously thought. The authors provide predictions for the electric
dipole polarizability and the weak form factor, quantities that are
currently targeted by precision measurements wordlwide. The authors
point also to how the predicted neutron distribution can be used to
constrain the size of neutron stars, opening up for a better understanding
of the link between the physics of minute objects like nuclei and 
massive stellar objects like neutron stars. 


Several of the collaborators have their education and training from the
University of Oslo.  Dr Gaute Hagen was a PhD student at the
University of Bergen and Oslo with Morten Hjorth-Jensen and Jan Vaagen
as supervisors.  Dr Hagen obtained his PhD in 2005 and has since then
been employed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the USA.  In 2013 he
received the Deparment of Energy's prestigious Young Investigator
award.  Gustav Jansen obtained his PhD at the University of Oslo in
2012 with Morten Hjorth-Jensen as supervisor.  
He is strongly involved in this project but has is funding elsewehere. 
He is now employed as a
researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Andreas Ekstroem has his
PhD from Lund University in Sweden and worked as a post-doctoral
fellow at the University of Oslo from 2010 to 2014. He was fully sponsored by this project from 2012 till 2014. He is now a
post-doctoral fellow at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and received recently an advanced researcher position from the Swedish Research Countil Vetenskapsraadet.
