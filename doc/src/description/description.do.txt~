===== Background =====

I am a theoretical physicist with a strong interest in computational physics and many-body theory in general, and the nuclear many-body problem and nuclear structure problems in particular. This means that I study various methods for solving either Schrödinger's equation or Dirac's equation for many interacting particles, spanning from algorithmic aspects to the mathematical properties of such methods. The latter also leads to a strong interest in computational physics as well as computational aspects of quantum mechanical methods. A large fraction of my work, in close collaboration with colleagues at Michigan State University, the University of Oslo, Oak Ridge National Laboratory as well as many other institutions worldwide, is devoted to a better understanding of various quantum mechanical algorithms. This activity leads to strong overlaps with other scientific fields. Although the main focus has been and is on many-body methods for nuclear structure problems, I have also done, and continue to do, research on solid state physics systems in addition to studies of the mathematical properties of various many-body methods.

The applications to many-body problems in nuclear physics lead also to many interactions with experimentalists and various experimental programs. The theories I participate in developing, have as final aims to be able to explain correlations in complicated many-body systems like nuclei and dense nuclear matter.

Why the nuclear many-body problem, you may ask. Well, for me, to understand why matter is stable, and thereby shed light on the limits of nuclear stability, is one of the overarching aims and intellectual challenges of basic research in nuclear physics and science. To relate the stability of matter to the underlying fundamental forces and particles of nature as manifested in nuclear matter is central to present and planned rare isotope facilities.

Examples of important properties of nuclear systems that can reveal information about these topics are masses (and thereby binding energies), and density distributions of nuclei. These are quantities that convey important information on the shell structure of nuclei with their pertinent magic numbers and shell closures, or the eventual disappearance of the latter away from the valley of stability.

Neutron-rich nuclei are particularly interesting. As a particular chain of isotopes becomes more and more neutron rich, one reaches finally the limit of stability, the so-called dripline, where one additional neutron makes the next isotopes unstable with respect to the previous ones. In a recent article published in Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 032502 (2012) we computed several properties of calcium isotopes, including three-body forces, a much debated and studied issue in nuclear many-body theory. Our calculations predict the dripline of the calcium isotopes at mass 60, partly in conflict with present results from mean-field and mass models used in astrophysical calculations. To understand the limits of stability of the calcium isotopes is one of the benchmarks experiments of the coming Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University. The computed first excited 2+ state for calcium-54 was later observed in an experiment published in Nature in 2013, confirming our theoretical predictions.

A promising recent development involves a proper parametrization of the strong force, resulting in better Hamiltonian for nuclear physics studies. Combining very powerful effective field theory derivations of the nuclear interaction and multidimensional optimization techniques, we were able to generate a very precise two-body interaction that reproduces experimental data in neutron rich oxygen and calcium isotopes.




Clusters are cumulants constructed from field-operator expectation values, and one can generate them by applying
the Wick's theorem or a correlation-generating function. While knowing all clusters defines a quantum
distribution[1], already the lowest clusters assign many simple properties such as mean and variance. Physically,
clusters correspond to a collection of particles stuck together [2], assigning important quasiparticles such as
excitons, dimers, Efimov states, Cooper pairs, dropletons[3].


Exact properties of cluster kinetics: Let C-cluster refer to a cluster with C particles. A C-cluster dynamics:
• can be derived exactly [2,4,5] and efficiently using the implicit-notation formalism [4] for a given
many-body Hamiltonian of a generic particle-photon-phonon system.
• follows from integro-differential equations [2,4,5] coupled via nonlinear scattering and hierarchical terms
containing low-C and (C+1)-clusters, respectively.
• can generate new clusters from the initial state only in a strict sequential order[2,4], after a suitable
downfolding or an excitation-picture [6] procedure is applied. This key feature is the key to efficient
computations of many-body dynamics.


Strengths of the approach:



• After finding a proper downfolding or excitation-picture procedure, hierarchy can be closed exactly up to
C-particle cluster before the (C+1)-clusters are formed (based on the key feature above).
• The resulting cluster kinetics is nonperturbative [2,7-9] in terms of interactions.
• Clusters efficiently describe nonequilibrium quantum kinetics [2,4,5] of many experimentally relevant
quantities such as polarization, currents, and magnetization.
• The cluster expansion determines many-body and quantum-optical effects at the same level, and works for
diverse systems ranging from strongly interacting atoms [10] to solids [5].
• The energy is an exact functional of few-particle clusters [3,11].


Challenges and possibilities for connections:
• Quantum kinetics is 1st principles, but determining the Hamiltonian for new materials requires, e.g.,
DFT/GW, Quantum Monte Carlo input to make all stages 1st principles.
• Finding suitable excitation picture is nontrivial – input from AMO and nuclear approaches?
• Cluster expansion includes all possibilities, which makes closed cluster equations lengthy – finding the
most relevant contributions can yield useful insights for other approaches.
• Truncating cluster dynamics works rigorously until (C+1)-clusters remain infinitesimal. The onset of
(C+1)-clusters can be approximated by introducing dissipation – compare to AMO/nuclear open-systems.
• Computing the interaction integrals requires most resources, and the inclusion of the “next” cluster level is
challenging because the numerical effort grows exponentially as function of C – could quantum Monte
Carlo /quasi Monte Carlo improve the scalability?
• One could develop correlation functional theory further – this could connect cluster-expansion,
quantum-Monte Carlo, and DFT in a search for new quasiparticles.
• Propagation toward thermodynamic equilibrium is demanding - hybrid methods needed.
