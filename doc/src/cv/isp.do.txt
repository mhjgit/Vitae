Since 1999 I have   established an activity in computational physics  at the  Department of Physics at the University of Oslo. I have also started from scratch and developed several  courses on computational physics and many-body physics. This activity was recognized with the Excellence in Teaching award from the University of Oslo in 2015. During the last 18 years I have guided  56 Master of Science of students (31 have continued with PhD studies) and 14 PhD students.  I currently supervise nine Master of Science students at the University of Oslo. I supervise three PhD students at Michigan State University. The present ISP grant has allowed to develop Computational Physics to an unprecentented level at the University of Oslo.

With colleagues at the University of Oslo, I have   been strongly involved in the development of a totally new teaching philosophy which merges computation with the traditional science amd mathematics curriculum . This project is called "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" and has received considerable support from the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Ministry of research and education.  It received the University of Oslo award for excellence in teaching  in 2011 and the NOKUT award in 2012.  It was recently award as a center of excellence in education as the new established Center for Computing in Science Education from December 2016. This has strengthened considerably Computational Physics and Science in general at the University of Oslo.
Based on these developments,  I initiated and lead the new "Master of Science program on Computational Science at the University of Oslo":"http://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/computational-science-master/". This is a new and multi-disciplinary program across several disciplines at the College of Natural Science of the University of Oslo. It includes now seven  departments at the faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of  the University of Oslo.  Together the new Master of Science program on Data Science, the university of Oslo is now in a position where Computational Data Sciences can be coordinated and addressed at a unique level nationally. The specter of courses offered in Computational Science and Data Science cover a broad spectrum, positioned UiO to meet the 3rd industrial reviolution where Machine Learning dan big data will play a central role.

Finally, With colleagues from the USA and other European countries, we have started the Nuclear Talent initiate":"http://www.nucleartalent.org",  where we aim  at providing an advanced and comprehensive training to graduate students and young researchers in low-energy nuclear theory.  The network aims at developing a broad curriculum that will provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding nuclei and nuclear reactions.  Within 2017 the initiative has run and developed twelve courses. I chaired the steering committee from its beginning in 2010 till 2015. I have taught and organized three of these courses and been one of the organizers on five of the twelve courses.
