===== Brief research overview =====

I am a theoretical physicist with a strong interest in 
computational physics and many-body theory in general, and 
the nuclear many-body problem and nuclear structure problems in particular. 
This means that I study various methods for solving either Schr√∂dinger's equation or 
Dirac's equation for many interacting particles, spanning from 
algorithmic aspects to the mathematical properties of such methods. 
The latter also leads to a strong interest in computational 
physics as well as computational aspects of quantum mechanical methods.
