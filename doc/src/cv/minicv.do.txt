===== Brief research overview =====

I am a theoretical physicist with a strong interest in 
computational physics and many-body theory in general, and 
the nuclear many-body problem and nuclear structure problems in particular. 
This means that I study various methods for solving either Schr√∂dinger's equation or 
Dirac's equation for many interacting particles, spanning from 
algorithmic aspects to the mathematical properties of such methods. 
The latter also leads to a strong interest in computational 
physics as well as computational aspects of quantum mechanical methods.

===== Synergistic Activities and service through the years: =====

* Since 1999 I have   established an activity in computational physics  at the  Department of Physics at the University of Oslo. I have also started from scratch and developed several  courses on computational physics and many-body physics. This activity was recognized with the Excellence in Teaching award from the University of Oslo in 2015. During the last fifteen years I have guided  51 Master of Science of students (29 have continued with PhD studies) and twelve PhD students.  I currently supervise twelve Master of Science students at the University of Oslo. I supervise five PhD students at Michigan State University.

* With colleagues at the University of Oslo, I have   been strongly involved in the development of a totally new teaching philosophy which merges computation with the traditional science amd mathematics curriculum . This project is called "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" and has received considerable support from the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Ministry of research and education.  It received the University of Oslo award for excellence in teaching  in 2011 and the NOKUT award in 2012. 

* With colleagues from the USA and other European countries, we have started the Nuclear Talent initiate":"http://www.nucleartalent.org",  where we aim  at providing an advanced and comprehensive training to graduate students and young researchers in low-energy nuclear theory.  The network aims at developing a broad curriculum that will provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding nuclei and nuclear reactions.  Within 2017 the initiative has run and developed twelve courses. I chaired the steering committee from its beginning in 2010 till 2015. I have taught and organized three of these courses and been one of the organizers on five of the twelve courses.

* I initiated and lead the new "Master of Science program on Computational Science at the University of Oslo":"http://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/computational-science-master/". This is a new and multi-disciplinary program across several disciplines at the College of Natural Science of the University of Oslo. It includes now seven  departments at the faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of  the University of Oslo.
