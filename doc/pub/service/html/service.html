<h2 id="___sec0">Synergistic Activities and service through the years: </h2>

<ul>
<li> Since 1999 I have   established an activity in computational physics  at the  Department of Physics at the University of Oslo. I have also started from scratch and developed several  courses on computational physics and many-body physics. This activity was recognized with the Excellence in Teaching award from the University of Oslo in 2015. During the last 20 years I have guided  more than 100 gradute students and post-doctoral fellows at Michigan State University and the University of Oslo.</li>
<li> With colleagues at the University of Oslo, I have   been strongly involved in the development of a totally new teaching philosophy which merges computation with the traditional science amd mathematics curriculum . This project is called <a href="http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" target="_blank">Computing in Science Education</a> and has received considerable support from the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Ministry of research and education.  It received the University of Oslo award for excellence in teaching  in 2011 and the NOKUT award in 2012.</li> 
<li> With colleagues from the USA and other European countries, we have started the Nuclear Talent initiate":"http://www.nucleartalent.org",  where we aim  at providing an advanced and comprehensive training to graduate students and young researchers in low-energy nuclear theory.  The network aims at developing a broad curriculum that will provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding nuclei and nuclear reactions.</li>  
<li> I initiated and lead the new <a href="http://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/computational-science-master/" target="_blank">Master of Science program on Computational Science at the University of Oslo</a>. This is a new and multi-disciplinary program across several disciplines at the College of Natural Science of the University of Oslo. It includes now seven  departments at the faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of  the University of Oslo.</li>
